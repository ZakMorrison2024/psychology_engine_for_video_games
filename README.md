# Psychology Engine for Video Games

The **Psychology Engine for Video Games** is a comprehensive tool designed to bring psychological realism to in-game characters. This engine includes the following components:


pfft its meant to be a lightweight speech engine with a few extra gimmicks, lets be real :L

- **Speech Engine**: Generates realistic dialogue and speech patterns based on character ego/emotional states.
- **Behaviour Probability Engine**: Determines and predicts character actions and responses based on psychological profiles and environmental factors.
- **Thought Engine**: Simulates the inner thoughts of characters, providing deeper insight into their motivations and reactions.
- **Very Basic "Memory"**: Remembers a few events.

## Features

- Realistic character speech synthesis based on psychological states.
- Dynamic behavior prediction using advanced probability algorithms.
- Thought processing that can be tied to characters' decisions and actions.

## Future Additions

- **Listener**: Will be added to allow characters to listen and respond to environmental cues and other characters.
- **Dynamic Adjusting**: Will enable characters to adapt and change their behavior in real-time based on evolving in-game events and interactions.

## TODO

### Bugs
- [ ] Fix minor inconsistencies in the speech generation algorithm.
- [ ] Improve the accuracy of behavior prediction in complex environments.
- [ ] Address synchronization issues between speech, behavior, and thought systems.
- [ ] Optimize performance when multiple characters are active in the scene.

### Features to Implement
- [ ] Add Listener component for environmental and character interactions.
- [ ] Implement dynamic adjusting of character behavior based on in-game events.
- [ ] Improve thought engine to handle long-term character development and evolution.
